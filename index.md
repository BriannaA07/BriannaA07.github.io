### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because it was the first time using loops. I was excited to use them in a real context after seeing them work on things like scratch. Part 2 had a hi-low game about guessing numbers and successfully seeing the code run work and pass all the make tests filled me with pride. 

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was one of my favorites because of the way I struggled through the assignments. This particularly confused me and when I finally understood it, it was enlightening. Being able to see the population density of different places compared to others that I was previously aware of was also very cool to see.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 had a very interesting concept knitting is an activity that does interest me and that made this lab much mire interesting. My favorite part of it trying to figure out why my code wouldnâ€™t output the right number of dashes. Eventually after figuring it out I came out with a better understanding of the code and assignment.
